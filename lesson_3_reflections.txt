* When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to make your work public, or collaborate with other people.

* Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There might be commits from other people that you don't want to pick up yet.  Maybe you need to
ensure your local copy is stable.
