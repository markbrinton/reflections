* What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The hidden .git directory is created which holds repository meta-info. 
This info is needed by git so it knows there's a repository.

* How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
  What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a snapshot of some file(s) at the point where they're ready to
be committed.  Having a staging area allows you to collect together a number of
files that are logically related to a single commit.
